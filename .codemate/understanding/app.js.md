# High-Level Documentation of app.js

## Overview

This file sets up an Express.js API server with enhanced security, logging, routing, and rate-limiting features. It serves both API and static content, and launches background services such as scheduled cron jobs and a Telegram bot handler if configured.

---

## Core Responsibilities

- **Environment and Global Setup**  
  - Loads environment variables.
  - Sets global crypto module.

- **Middleware & Security**  
  - Helmet for HTTP header protection.
  - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.
  - Body parsing (JSON and URL-encoded).
  - Simple file-based logger.
  - Request rate limiting (per IP).

- **Routing**  
  - Modular API routes for authentication, business logic, configuration, and remarks.
  - Static file hosting from a `public` directory.
  - Custom endpoints for health checks and serving main HTML pages.

- **Error Handling**  
  - Custom 404 handler for unknown endpoints.
  - Centralized error-handling middleware.

- **Server Startup & Services Initialization**  
  - Starts the server on configurable port.
  - On server start:
    - Initializes cron jobs for background tasks.
    - Optionally initializes a Telegram bot if the relevant token is configured.

## Key Features

- **Security**  
  Secure headers, rate-limiting, and CORS.

- **API Modularization**  
  Clean separation of route logic using imported route files.

- **Statics & SPA Support**  
  Serves static files like HTML, CSS, JS.

- **Health Check**  
  Provides an endpoint (`/health`) for service liveness.

- **Background Tasks**  
  Integrates cron jobs for scheduled background processes.

- **Optional Integration**  
  Telegram bot handler is conditionally started if credentials are present.

---

## Notable Endpoints

- `GET /`  
  Loads the login page.
- `GET /index.html`  
  Loads the main application page.
- `GET /health`  
  Shows service status, timestamp, and uptime.
- `*`  
  Custom 404 for unmatched routes.
- Various `/api/...` endpoints for business logic.

---

## Configuration

- Reads from `.env` for server port, environment, and Telegram bot token.
- Uses production-optimized static file caching if in production mode.

---

## Error and Log Handling

- Uses a simple logger abstraction (prints to console).
- Handles and reports application errors gracefully, both in the API and at service initialization.

---

## Extensibility

- Easy to add new API routes by importing modules.
- Simple structure to add background jobs or integrate more messaging/notification handlers.

---

**Summary**:  
This is a secure, modular, production-ready Express.js application base that exposes business APIs, serves static content, protects from common attack vectors, and integrates with background and messaging services in a highly configurable way.

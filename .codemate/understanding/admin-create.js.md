This script is designed to add an admin user to a database for an application, utilizing Node.js, SQLite, and password hashing for security. Here is an overview of its functionality:

1. **Imports Dependencies**  
   - Loads a local database module (`db`), which provides a connection to the application's database.
   - Uses the `bcryptjs` library for hashing passwords securely.

2. **Admin User Credentials Setup**  
   - Defines a username (e.g., 'admin') and a plaintext password.
   - Hashes the provided password with bcrypt to ensure secure storage in the database.

3. **Database Interaction**  
   - Executes an SQL INSERT command to add a new user record with the username, securely hashed password, and user role set as 'admin'.

4. **Error Handling & Feedback**  
   - If the insertion is successful, logs the ID of the created user.
   - If there is an error (e.g., user already exists, DB issue), it logs the error message.

5. **Resource Cleanup**  
   - Closes the database connection upon completion of the operation.

**Purpose**:  
This script automates the one-time creation of an administrative user in the user database, ensuring the password is stored securely using industry-standard hashing. It is useful during initial setup or when provisioning admin access for a freshly deployed system.

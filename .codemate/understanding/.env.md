# High-Level Documentation: Environment Configuration

This configuration file is designed to provide environment variables for a server application. Below is an overview of each section and its purpose:

---

### 1. Server Configuration

- **PORT**: Defines the port on which the server listens (default: 80).
- **NODE_ENV**: Specifies the environment mode (e.g., development, production).

---

### 2. JWT (JSON Web Token) Configuration

- **JWT_SECRET**: A critical secret key used for signing and verifying JWTs. Essential for authentication and should be set to a secure random value.

---

### 3. Database Configuration

- **DB_PATH**: Filesystem path to the SQLite database file used by the application.

---

### 4. Email (SMTP) Configuration

- **SES_SMTP_HOST**: Host address for the SMTP relay (e.g., AWS SES or other providers).
- **SES_SMTP_PORT**: The port for SMTP communication (commonly 587 for TLS).
- **EMAIL_FROM_SES_SMTP**: The "From" address for outgoing emails, which must be a verified sender.

---

### 5. Telegram Bot Integration

- **TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN**: Token for authenticating a Telegram bot, provided by @BotFather. Needed for Telegram-related features.
- **INTERNAL_API_TOKEN**: Internal token used for authorizing internal API requests.

---

### 6. Cron Job Configuration

- **CRON_DEBUG_LOGGING**: Enables or disables debug logging for scheduled (cron) jobs.

---

### 7. Rate Limiting

- **RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS**: The time window (in milliseconds) during which requests are counted for rate limiting.
- **RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS**: Maximum number of requests allowed per window per client.

---

### 8. Security

- **BCRYPT_ROUNDS**: Number of salt rounds for bcrypt password hashing, affecting the computational cost and security.
- **SESSION_TIMEOUT**: Specifies the session expiration time (e.g., 8 hours).

---

**Note:**  
Values like `JWT_SECRET` and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` must be securely set before deployment. Default/example values are placeholders and must be changed for production environments.

---

**Purpose:**  
These environment variables collectively configure the serverâ€™s core components, including web server parameters, security/authentication, database location, external service integrations (email, Telegram), background job scheduling, protection mechanisms (rate limiting), and other security measures. Adjust these variables to suit deployment, development, or staging setups.

# Configuration Review Report

The following is a critical review of your environment configuration file, pointing out potential issues, industry-standard suggestions, and optimization opportunities. Corrections are provided in **pseudo code** as requested.

---

## 1. Server Configuration

### Issue: Listening on Port 80
- **Industry Practice:** Privileged ports (i.e. `<1024` like 80) require root privileges and are not recommended, especially in development.
- **Suggestion:** Use a higher, non-privileged port for development, e.g., 3000 or 8080.
```pseudo
PORT=3000  # changed from 80 for development safety
```

---

## 2. JWT Configuration

### Issue: Weak JWT secret placeholder
- **Critical Risk:** Default JWT secrets often get deployed by mistake.
- **Suggestion:** Never use hard-coded or sample secrets. Force developer to provide this via script/CI or document to fail fast.
```pseudo
JWT_SECRET=  # LEAVE EMPTY and require on server start, or pull from a secure vault
```

---

## 3. Database Configuration

### Issue: Relative database path
- **Note:** Using a relative path may lead to inconsistent DB locations when running from different directories.
- **Suggestion:** Use absolute path, or make sure your application root is explicit.
```pseudo
DB_PATH=/abs/path/to/data/nobet.db  # Replace with runtime-detected path or env var
```

---

## 4. Email / SMTP Configuration

### Issue: Expose internal SMTP details in public repo
- **Recommendation:** Donâ€™t store SMTP host info in public env files, or rotate frequently.
- **Suggestion:** Mask sensitive info in distributed config, or load from vault/secret manager in production.
```pseudo
SES_SMTP_HOST=        # blank by default, populate only securely in deployment
SES_SMTP_PORT=        # ^
```
### Issue: Email sender leakage
- **Warning:** Sender addresses should be variables, not hard-coded.
```pseudo
EMAIL_FROM_SES_SMTP=  # Pull from env or config vault
```

---

## 5. Telegram & Internal API Tokens

### Issue: Sensitive tokens checked into plain text/configuration files
- **Critical Risk:** Replace, auto-rotate on every deployment, and **never** push secrets in code/config tracked by VCS.
```pseudo
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=        # Leave blank; pull from secret manager
INTERNAL_API_TOKEN=        # Leave blank; use KMS/secret store in prod
```

---

## 6. Cron Debug Logging

### Issue: Verbose logs in production
- **Suggestion:** Set debug logging defaults based on `NODE_ENV`.
```pseudo
CRON_DEBUG_LOGGING=false  # or set via if NODE_ENV === production
```

---

## 7. Rate Limiting

### Issue: Rate limit thresholds
- **Warning:** 100 requests in 15 minutes (900000 ms) may be too lenient.
- **Suggestion:** Review, and possibly lower, rate limit for public APIs.
```pseudo
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=60  # e.g. reduce if abuse is a concern
```

---

## 8. Security

### Issue: Bcrypt cost rounds
- **Note:** 12 rounds are industry-standard, but monitor CPU usage.
- **Suggestion:** Periodically review cost parameter for hardware trends.

### Issue: Session timeout format
- **Standardization:** Make sure your app expects a human-readable format (`8h`) or convert to milliseconds.
```pseudo
SESSION_TIMEOUT=28800000  # milliseconds (8h), if code expects that
```
or document the expected units clearly.

---

## GENERAL SUGGESTIONS

1. **Never hard-code or commit secrets**:
   - Use secret managers, environment variables injected at deploy/runtime, or `.env.example` templates.
2. **Automate placeholder checks in CI**:
   - Error if config contains placeholder secrets/tokens.
3. **Add comments to make requirements clear**.

# Summary of Pseudocode Corrections

```pseudo
PORT=3000  # Higher port for dev safety
JWT_SECRET=  # Required, do NOT use unsafe default, fail if empty
DB_PATH=/abs/path/to/data/nobet.db  # Or robust path-resolving mechanism
SES_SMTP_HOST=
SES_SMTP_PORT=
EMAIL_FROM_SES_SMTP=
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
INTERNAL_API_TOKEN=
CRON_DEBUG_LOGGING=false  # Enable only in development
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=60
SESSION_TIMEOUT=28800000  # if expecting ms, else clarify
```

---

> **ACTION REQUIRED:**  
> Remove all sensitive values from committed configuration files. Always use a protected approach for credentials and secrets!  
>  
> Add `.env.example` with non-working sample values and document all variables for onboarding developers.

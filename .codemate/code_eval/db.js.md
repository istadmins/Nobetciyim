# Critical Code Review Report: `Nobetciyim/db.js`

## Overview

This code is a Node.js module that handles SQLite database initialization and exposes several methods for a duty roster system. It includes schema creation, utility logger, and DB operations. The code demonstrates reasonable organization, but there are multiple improvement points in line with current industry standards, security best practices, and performance considerations.

---

### 1. **Security: Logging Sensitive Data**

**Issue:**  
Some functions log errors using `console.error` directly instead of the provided `logger.error()`. Also, care should be taken with logging `password` or sensitive data even in error messages (though none here directly show as such).

**Corrected/Preferred lines (pseudo code):**
```js
if (err) { logger.error("DB Error (getAktifNobetci):", err); reject(err); }
// ...and similar for all instances of console.error in database callbacks:
logger.error(`DB Error (updateNobetciKredi - ID: ${nobetciId}):`, err);
```
*Apply logger in all places for consistent log level handling and future extensibility (e.g., log file support, masking, etc).*

---

### 2. **Error Handling: Transactions**

**Issue:**  
The code mixes callback-based transaction statements (`BEGIN TRANSACTION;`) with following statements that do not guarantee sequence. There is potential risk that `db.run("BEGIN TRANSACTION;")` completes after the next `db.run` starts because these are asynchronous.  
Additionally, transaction begin/commit/rollback should use the same connection and error handling should be more robust.

**Better practice (pseudo code):**
```js
db.serialize(() => {
    // All these statements now execute in order
    db.run("BEGIN TRANSACTION;", (err) => {
        if (err) return handleError();

        db.run(..., function(err) {
            if (err) {
                db.run("ROLLBACK;", () => reject(...));
                return;
            }
            // Continue update/commit/resolve code
        });
    });
});
```
*But in practice, using a library like [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) or [sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite) for promise/async/await support and proper transaction would be much safer and cleaner.*

### 3. **Performance: Schema/Index Creation on Startup**

**Issue:**  
Creating tables and indexes on every startup can create a performance bottleneck, especially with many cases or if schema evolves.  
`db.serialize` mitigates concurrency, but migrations should be handled with a migration tool (e.g., [knex](http://knexjs.org/), [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)), or explicit version scripts.

**Suggested improvement (pseudo code):**
```js
// Replace custom initialization with a managed migration tool.
runDatabaseMigrationsIfNecessary();
```

---

### 4. **Maintainability: Hard-Coded SQL in Application Code**

**Issue:**  
SQL queries are hard-coded. This is standard for small personal projects, but for codebase maintainability, queries could be extracted to their own files/modules, or use a query-builder.

---

### 5. **Data Validation: Database Write Operations**

**Issue:**  
There is a lack of input validation/sanitization before writing to the database in several methods (e.g., `updateNobetciKredi`). For public API inputs, validation checking type, range, and structure is best.

**Corrected (pseudo code):**
```js
if (!Number.isInteger(nobetciId) || nobetciId <= 0) return reject(new Error("Invalid ID"));
if (!Number.isInteger(yeniKredi) || yeniKredi < 0) return reject(new Error("Invalid Credit Value"));
```

---

### 6. **Concurrency: Single Connection Limitation**

**Issue:**  
All operations share a single instance of sqlite3â€™s `Database` object. In high concurrency, `sqlite3` queueing can become a bottleneck or cause unexpected locks. Using WAL mode may help, but for higher concurrency, pooled or connectionless solutions are advised.

**Suggested addition (pseudo code):**
```js
db.run('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL');
```
*Set immediately after connection to help with concurrency.*

---

### 7. **Resource Management: Database Connection Termination**

**Issue:**  
There is no handler for graceful shutdown (`SIGINT` etc.) to close the sqlite DB connection cleanly, which may lead to corruption risk if app is stopped.

**Suggested addition (pseudo code):**
```js
process.on('SIGINT', () => {
    db.close(err => {
       if (err) logger.error('Error closing DB', err);
       process.exit(0);
    });
});
```

---

### 8. **Environment Variable Use and Path Handling**

**Issue:**  
Potential error when using `path.dirname(process.env.DB_PATH || './data/nobet.db')`:  
If `process.env.DB_PATH` is a filename without directory, `path.dirname` returns `'.'`. Thus, the resulting `dataDir` might not be intended.

**Suggested correction:**
```js
const dbPath = process.env.DB_PATH || './data/nobet.db';
const dataDir = path.dirname(path.resolve(dbPath));
if (!fs.existsSync(dataDir)) { ... }
```
*This ensures that the folder check works no matter what variant user provides in env.*

---

### 9. **Minor: Magic Numbers and DRY Principle**

Magic numbers for years, weeks, etc. should be declared as consts for maintainability.
```js
const MIN_YEAR = 2020, MAX_YEAR = 2050, MIN_WEEK = 1, MAX_WEEK = 53;
```

---

### 10. **Function Parameter Checking and Documentation**

Documenting parameters with JSDoc, and runtime type verification at API boundaries helps prevent bugs.

**Example improvement:**
```js
/**
 * Update a user's credit.
 * @param {number} nobetciId - ID of the user to update.
 * @param {number} yeniKredi - New credit value.
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
```

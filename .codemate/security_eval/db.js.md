# Security Vulnerability Assessment Report  
**Target File:** Nobetciyim/db.js  
**Assessment Date:** 2024-06  
**Scope:** Focused solely on security vulnerabilities found in the code.

---

## 1. Credential and Secret Handling

### Vulnerability: Plaintext Password Storage

**Finding:**  
Both the `Nobetciler` and `users` tables store a `password TEXT NOT NULL` field. There is no evidence in this file of any hashing or encryption before storing passwords, which means passwords may be stored in plaintext.

**Risk:**  
Storing passwords in plaintext is a severe security risk. If the database is accessed by an attacker (through SQL injection, server compromise, backups leaks, etc.), all user credentials are immediately compromised.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement strong, slow hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for all passwords **before** inserting them into the database.
- Never store, log, or transmit plaintext passwords under any circumstances.

---

## 2. Database Access and SQL Injection

### Vulnerability: Use of Parameterized Queries

**Finding:**  
All SQL query functions reviewed (`db.getNobetciById`, `db.getDutyOverride`, `db.updateNobetciKredi`, etc.) use parameterized queries (i.e., bind variables). This is good practice and mitigates classical SQL injection attacks.

**Positive Note:**  
No instances of dynamic SQL (e.g., direct string concatenation from user input) have been found in this file.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure all code calling these methods also enforces numeric/string validation before passing input to prevent logic errors or bypasses.

---

## 3. Filesystem and Path Handling

### Vulnerability: Environment Variable `DB_PATH`

**Finding:**  
The path to the SQLite database is set via the `DB_PATH` environment variable or defaults to `./data/nobet.db`. The code safely uses `path.dirname()` and `fs.existsSync`/`fs.mkdirSync` to create the directory if needed. However, since `DB_PATH` is environment-controlled, a maliciously set variable may point to any location on the filesystem.

**Risk:**  
- Potential for **directory traversal** or **arbitrary file writes** if `DB_PATH` is set to an unintended location.
- Unintended database file manipulation, overwriting files, or writing sensitive data outside intended locations.

**Recommendation:**  
- Restrict allowed values for `DB_PATH` via allow lists or sanitization.
- Run the application with filesystem permissions scoped to a chroot/jail or within containers for defense-in-depth.
- Consider logging a warning if `DB_PATH` is set outside the application's intended data directory.

## 4. Sensitive Data in Logs

### Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Logging

**Finding:**  
The logger is used throughout for error and information reporting. Error messages (`console.error`) may include exceptions or content from failed queries. While SQL queries themselves seem safe, over-logging error details (e.g., stack traces, exception messages) may expose sensitive internal information.

**Risk:**  
- Stack traces or error messages may expose sensitive paths, database schema details, or unexpected data to logs if not properly monitored or secured.

**Recommendation:**  
- Limit log verbosity in production.
- Avoid logging sensitive user-provided data.
- Secure access to application logs.

---

## 5. Reset Password Tokens

### Vulnerability: Storage of Password Reset Tokens

**Finding:**  
The `users` table contains fields: `reset_password_token` and `reset_password_expires`. There is no evidence that reset tokens are hashed or protected before being stored.

**Risk:**  
If the database is compromised, knowing the `reset_password_token` allows attackers to reset user passwords.

**Recommendation:**  
- Hash reset tokens before storing them in the database (as done for passwords).
- Never store reset tokens in plaintext.

---

## 6. Lack of Defense-in-Depth Features

### Issue: No Row-level Encryption or Extra Protection

**Finding:**  
No row-level or field-level encryption is applied for sensitive fields such as `telefon_no`, `email`, etc.

**Risk:**  
Attackers who obtain access to the database will be able to read all user information.

**Recommendation:**  
- Strongly consider encryption for personally identifiable information (PII).
- Assess privacy requirements based on user data stored.

---

## 7. Incomplete Protection Against Privilege Escalation

### Vulnerability: User Role Enumeration

**Finding:**  
The `users` table has a `role` field (`user` or `admin`). Role escalation protection is highly dependent on application logic outside this file, but any vulnerabilities in user creation or direct DB access may lead to privilege escalation.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure all changes to the `role` field are properly authorized and validated elsewhere.
- Apply **least privilege** principles in all application logic.

---

## 8. Database File Permissions

### Issue: No Umask or File Mode Configuration

**Finding:**  
No explicit setting of file permissions when creating the database file with SQLite.

**Risk:**  
On some systems, this may result in a world-readable/writable database file.

**Recommendation:**  
- Set `umask` appropriately for the process.
- Restrict permissions of the data directory and database file (`chmod 600`).

# Final Notes

- **Password handling is the most critical issue and should be addressed immediately.**
- Review all input validation and output encoding in higher-level code interacting with this module.
- Security is a processâ€”ensure ongoing reviews and updates as the application evolves.

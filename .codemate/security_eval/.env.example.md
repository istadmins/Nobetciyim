# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided server configuration code for **security vulnerabilities**. The .env-like configuration includes server, JWT, database, SMTP, Telegram, and security parameters.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Sensitive Secrets and Credentials

#### Issues:
- **JWT_SECRET**, **SES_SMTP_USER**, **SES_SMTP_PASSWORD**, **TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN**, and **INTERNAL_API_TOKEN** are stored in plaintext.
- Comments instruct to "change this in production", indicating a risk if not enforced.
- If this file is ever committed to a public repository, these secrets could be exposed, leading to potential full system compromise.

#### Examples:
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-change-this-in-production
SES_SMTP_USER=your-ses-smtp-username
SES_SMTP_PASSWORD=your-ses-smtp-password
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token-here
```

#### Impact:
- Account takeovers, unauthorized access, mail abuse, bot compromise.

#### Recommendation:
- Store secrets in a secure secrets manager or vault.
- Never commit real secrets to version control.
- Use environment-specific configuration and enforce secrets rotation.

---

### 2. Use of Default/Weak Example Secrets

#### Issues:
- Placeholders such as `your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-change-this-in-production` and `your-ses-smtp-password` are weak and not randomized.
- There is no enforcement or automation that ensures these values are properly replaced.

#### Impact:
- If applications use these defaults, attackers can easily guess the secrets.

#### Recommendation:
- Enforce secret checking in CI/CD (e.g., tools like git-secrets).
- Validate on startup that secrets are not placeholders.

---

### 3. Database File Path Exposed

#### Issues:
- `DB_PATH=./data/nobet.db` saves the SQLite DB in a potentially insecure, predictable location.
- If the directory is accessible to the web server or users, it can be stolen, copied, or tampered with.

#### Impact:
- Database compromise, data exfiltration, tampering.

#### Recommendation:
- Restrict access permissions to the file and directory.
- Store outside of web root with correct file system permissions.

---

### 4. Network Services on Default/Privileged Ports

#### Issues:
- `PORT=80` uses HTTP (not HTTPS).
- No mention of configuring HTTPS or restricting to localhost/internal interfaces.

#### Impact:
- Traffic interception, MITM attacks, session hijacking.

#### Recommendation:
- Use TLS/HTTPS (`PORT=443`) in production.
- Secure private service interfaces.

---

### 5. SMTP Credentials in Configuration

#### Issues:
- Full SMTP credentials in plaintext.

#### Impact:
- Email account takeovers, spam, reputational damage.

#### Recommendation:
- See point 1 about secrets management.

---

### 6. Telegram Bot Token in .env File

#### Issues:
- Disclosure of bot token allows full control of that botâ€™s interactions and messages.

#### Impact:
- Malicious messages, data theft.

#### Recommendation:
- See point 1 about secrets management.

---

### 7. Lack of Environment Isolation

#### Issues:
- Configuration does not enforce separation for different environments (prod/test/dev).
- Accidental use of production secrets in unsafe environments.

#### Recommendation:
- Use per-environment files and segregate secrets properly.

---

### 8. No Mention of Brute-Force Protection for Sensitive Operations

#### Issues:
- Rate limiting is defined, but may not be robust enough against targeted attacks.
- No mention of monitoring or alerts.

#### Recommendation:
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
- Ensure rate limits are enforced specifically on authentication/critical endpoints.

| Weak/default example secrets                   | Guessable secrets, easy compromise             | Enforce strong, unique, random secrets      |
| DB file in predictable location                | Data theft/modification                        | Restrict access, store securely             |
| Service listens on insecure port (HTTP only)   | MITM, sniffing, session hijack                 | Use HTTPS, secure cert management           |
| Plaintext SMTP credentials                     | Email abuse, spam, account theft               | Secrets manager, rotate regularly           |
| Telegram bot token in env                      | Bot hijack, malicious operation                | Secure token management                     |
| No environment isolation                       | Production data in dev/test; leakage           | Separate environment configs and secrets    |
| Weak/broad rate limiting                       | Brute-force attacks                            | Monitor + adapt rate-limiting               |

## Conclusion

Move all sensitive information out of plaintext and version-controlled configuration. Enforce strong secrets, environment separation, proper file permissions, and use HTTPS for all public services. Enable regular reviews and secret rotation policies.

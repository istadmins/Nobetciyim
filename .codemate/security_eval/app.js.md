# Security Vulnerability Report for `app.js`

This report details **security vulnerabilities** identified in the provided code, with explanations and remediation suggestions. Only security aspects are analyzed.

---

## 1. CORS Configuration

**Vulnerability:**  
```js
app.use(cors());
```
`cors()` without arguments enables CORS for all origins. This can lead to:
- Unauthorized websites accessing your API
- Increased exposure to CSRF/XSS attacks

**Recommendation:**  
Configure CORS with an explicit list of trusted origins:
```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['https://yourdomain.com'], // Replace with actual domains
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  credentials: true
}));
```

---

## 2. Serving Static Files Publicly

**Vulnerability:**  
```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'), ...));
```
Serving the entire `public` directory could inadvertently expose sensitive files (such as backups, configuration, etc.) if not properly segmented.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure the `public` directory does not contain sensitive files.
- Consider using [serve-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static) options like `dotfiles: 'ignore'`.
- Example:
  ```js
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'), {
    maxAge: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '1d' : '0',
    etag: true,
    dotfiles: 'ignore'
  }));
  ```

---

## 3. Use of HTTP (Port 80)

**Vulnerability:**  
```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 80;
```
Running a public service on port 80 without TLS/SSL exposes all traffic (data leakage, session hijacking, MITM).

**Recommendation:**  
- Use HTTPS in production, redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- Use certificates (e.g., via LetsEncrypt).
- Example:
  - Behind a reverse proxy (Nginx) which terminates SSL.
  - Or use [express-sslify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-sslify) to enforce HTTPS in-app.

---

## 4. Unrestricted File Paths in `sendFile`

**Vulnerability:**  
```js
res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'login.html'));
```
`sendFile` with controlled paths is generally safe when params are not user-controlled. However, moving forward, routing or referencing files by user input can introduce [directory traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) risks.

**Recommendation:**  
- For static content, rely on express.static unless you need to send specific files.
- Validate any filename/path that may come from user input (not currently in this code, but for future extension).

---

## 5. Unrestricted Error Logging

**Vulnerability:**  
```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Error:', err);
  res.status(500).json({ ... });
});
```
`console.error` may log sensitive error details (stack traces, user info) to stdout/logs. While not sent to users, logs should be sanitized to avoid leaking sensitive information especially if logs are centralized.

**Recommendation:**  
- Log only necessary information.
- Mask sensitive data before logging (custom error handling).

---

## 6. No Input Validation / Sanitization

**Vulnerability:**  
There is no input validation or sanitization for incoming requests:
```js
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```
Payloads from end users are trusted as-is, which can lead to:
- Injection attacks (SQL/NoSQL, Command, etc.)
- DoS via invalid or excessively large payloads

**Recommendation:**  
- Use validation libraries ([Joi](https://joi.dev/), [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/)) to validate all input.
- Example:
  ```js
  const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
  // Use in routes for request validation
  ```

---

## 7. Environment Variable Exposure

**Vulnerability:**  
```js
logger.info(`Environment: ${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}`);
```
Controlled logging, but be mindful not to log sensitive env variables (`.env` may contain secrets, tokens, etc.). Only log non-sensitive configuration.

---

## 8. Background Cron and Telegram Bot Initialization

**Risk Area:**  
Initialization of cron jobs and the Telegram bot handler by requiring files:
```js
require('./cron-jobs.js');
const telegramBotHandler = require('./telegram_bot_handler.js');
```
If those files source external or dynamic code (not shown), there is risk of [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection).

**Recommendation:**  
- **Ensure that `cron-jobs.js` and `telegram_bot_handler.js` are secure** and do not execute or require untrusted code.

---

## 9. Global Exposure of `crypto`

**Risk:**  
```js
global.crypto = require('crypto');
```
Making Node's crypto global could cause future confusion or allow other scripts/libraries to use/modify it unexpectedly.

**Recommendation:**  
- Limit `crypto` exposure to only where needed; do not attach to `global`.

---

## 10. Rate Limiting â€” Insufficient Constraints

**Risk:**  
```js
max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
```
Depending on your application, 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP may be insufficient to prevent abuse, especially from large networks/attackers. Not specific to code, but configuration.

**Recommendation:**  
- Tune rate limiting according to expected traffic.
- Consider more advanced protection (user-account throttling, captcha, etc.)

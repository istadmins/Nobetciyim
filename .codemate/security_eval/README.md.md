# Security Vulnerability Report: Nobetciyim - Duty Schedule Management System

This report analyzes the **security vulnerabilities** based solely on the provided code documentation and configuration. **No source implementation was provided, so assessment is based on documentation, configuration, and described features**. 
Below are potential vulnerabilities and risky areas:

---

## 1. Insecure Defaults

### JWT Secret
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-change-this-in-production
```
- **Issue:** The documentation and `.env` example provide a placeholder secret. If not changed for production, this is a critical vulnerability.
- **Risk:** If deployed with this default, JWT tokens can be forged, compromising authentication.
- **Mitigation:** The application should refuse to start with default/weak secrets (environment variable check).

---

## 2. Insufficiently Protected Sensitive Configuration

### Example Credentials in .env
- **Issue:** Default values for SMTP, JWT, and other secrets may be copied into production if not changed.
- **Risk:** Credentials leakage or misconfiguration could lead to account compromises (e.g., SMTP abuse, Telegram bot hijack).
- **Mitigation:** Harden documentation to warn against defaults and implement startup checks for weak secrets.

---

## 3. Password Security Settings

### bcrypt Rounds
```env
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
```
- **Analysis:** 12 rounds is usually acceptable. However, if the value is set too low for performance, passwords are at risk.
- **Risk:** Low rounds means faster brute force.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce lower bound for `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` at application startup (e.g., minimum of 10).

---

## 4. Database Exposure and Data Confidentiality

### SQLite Database Configuration
```env
DB_PATH=./data/nobet.db
```
- **Risk:** If the `data/` folder is publicly mapped via Docker or web server, the database could be downloaded, exposing all data (e.g., user hashes, tokens, credits).
- **Mitigation:** Make sure the `data` folder is not exposed as static assets.

---

## 5. Docker Volume Permissions and Secrets Leakage

- **Risk:** The database and log directories are mapped as writable volumes. If host permissions are weak, unprivileged users may access logs or database files.
- **Mitigation:** 
    - Restrict host access to only the application user.
    - Run containers as non-root users.
    - Harden the Dockerfile (not shown here).

---

## 6. Email & Telegram Credentials Leakage

- **Risk:** If `.env` is checked into version control or present in distributed images, SMTP and bot tokens are at risk.
- **Mitigation:** Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (explicitly state in docs). Secure Docker build contexts.

---

## 7. Rate Limiting Misconfiguration

```env
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```
- **Risk:** Configuration allows 100 requests per 15 minutes per client, which might be lenient for authentication endpoints.
- **Mitigation:** Use tighter limits for authentication endpoints to slow brute-force.

---

## 8. Mixed HTTP/HTTPS and Use of Port 80

```env
PORT=80
```
- **Risk:** By default, the application runs on HTTP port 80. Sensitive information (passwords, JWT tokens) may be sent in plaintext if not protected behind an HTTPS reverse proxy.
- **Mitigation:** Strongly advise (and document) running behind an HTTPS (TLS) reverse proxy. HTTP should not be used for authentication APIs in production.

---

## 9. JWT Authentication Concerns

- **Risk:** No mention of JWT expiration or refresh window configuration. Poor JWT expiry can lead to session hijacking if tokens are long-lived.
- **Mitigation:** Document and enforce reasonable JWT expirations.

---

## 10. CSRF & CORS Protection

- **Claim:** Use of Helmet for security headers and mention of CSRF protection.
- **Observation:** No mention of explicit CORS policy.
- **Risk:** If CORS is not restricted, APIs may be called from unauthorized domains.
- **Mitigation:** Confirm CORS headers restrict access to trusted origins.

---

## 11. Logging of Sensitive Data

- **Risk:** Logs are written to `logs/error.log` and `logs/combined.log`. Possible risk if logs contain JWTs, secrets, or sensitive user data.
- **Mitigation:** Review logging implementation to ensure no authentication tokens or credentials are logged.

---

## 12. Password Reset Functionality

- **Risk:** Password reset endpoint (`/api/auth/initiate-password-reset`) via email could be abused if rate limiting or CAPTCHA is not enforced, leading to email spam or account enumeration.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce strict rate limits for password reset endpoints.

---

## 13. API Token Secrets

```env
INTERNAL_API_TOKEN=your-internal-api-token-here
```
- **Risk:** Default token values must be replaced. If not, internal logic may be compromised.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce strong token detection and startup checks.

---

## 14. Backups and Old Data in Mounted Volumes

- **Risk:** Docker volumes may accumulate backups/old versions of database files with sensitive data.
- **Mitigation:** Document secure cleanup practices and recommend encrypted volumes if sensitive data present.

# Recommendations

- **Never deploy with default/example secrets**â€”enforce runtime checks.
- **Enforce HTTPS for all authentication and data endpoints**.
- **Harden rate-limiting**; especially on authentication routes and password reset.
- **Audit logging** to ensure secrets and sensitive information are never logged.
- **Restrict Docker and server volume permissions** to the application user.
- **Document and enforce strong CORS policies** to prevent unauthorized API access.
- **Ensure password hashes always use strong bcrypt cost factors**.
- **Advise/Enforce periodic review and replacement of sensitive tokens and secrets**.
- **Confirm email and Telegram credentials are never stored insecurely or in public repositories**.
- **Review health check and monitoring endpoints for unrestricted access** (possible info-leak).

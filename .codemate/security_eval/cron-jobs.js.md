# Security Vulnerability Assessment Report

## File: `Nobetciyim/cron-jobs.js`

This report analyzes only **security vulnerabilities** present in the provided code.

---

## 1. Logging Sensitive Data

- **Description:** The functions `logDebug` and `logCreditUpdate` log potentially sensitive runtime information (active on-call staff names, credit updates, etc.) to the console. These log entries are controlled by environment variables (`CRON_DEBUG_LOGGING` and `NODE_ENV`). However, there is no sanitization of the logged data, no log redaction, and no indication of log retention policies.

- **Risk:** If logs are accessible to unauthorized individuals (e.g., container output aggregation, shared log stores), personal or sensitive information could be exposed.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Ensure logs are properly secured and access is restricted.
  - Redact or sanitize personally identifiable information (PII) when logging.
  - Document log retention and deletion practices.

---

## 2. Lack of Input Validation (Database Layer)

- **Description:** Throughout the code, critical functions interact with the database, for example:
  - `db.updateNobetciKredi(aktifNobetci.id, yeniKredi);`
  - `db.setAktifNobetci(hedefNobetci.id);`
  - `db.getAktifNobetci();`
  - `db.getAllKrediKurallari();`
  - `db.getShiftTimeRanges();`
  - `db.getAllNobetcilerWithTelegramId();`
  
  There is **no input validation or sanitization** for the data coming from or going to the database. If any of these functions are externally/exploitably modifiable, there is the risk of SQL Injection (if code is using SQL under-the-hood), or other data-tampering attacks.

- **Risk:** Unvalidated/unfiltered input can lead to injection attacks or data corruption, especially if the data store is SQL-based and not using parameterized/prepared queries everywhere.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Ensure that all database inputs are validated and/or sanitized before use.
  - Use parameterized queries in the data access layer.
  - Explicitly check and whitelist allowed properties for data entries.

## 3. Absence of Error Obfuscation

- **Description:** Error messages (including `error.message`, `error.stack`) are printed to the console, and potentially include stack traces or PII. In production systems, stack traces may expose internal implementation details or secrets.

- **Risk:** Attackers can use stack traces for reconnaissance.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Log generic error messages in production. Avoid printing stack traces or sensitive details to logs.
  - Use environment-based controls to limit detailed error output to `development` mode only.

---

## 4. External API/Service (Telegram) - Unprotected Usage

- **Description:** The code uses `sendTelegramMessageToGroup(user.telegram_id, message)` to send notifications. There is no indication that Telegram IDs are validated before use, and mass messaging is performed in a loop without rate limiting or error trigger logic.

- **Risk:**  
  - If Telegram IDs are not trustworthy, attackers could inject arbitrary IDs and receive sensitive notifications.
  - Uncontrolled message sending could allow for spamming, denial of service (against the bot/account), or leakage of information to unauthorized users.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Validate and sanitize all communication IDs.
  - Implement access controls to ensure only authorized users receive notifications.
  - Introduce rate limiting or error handling to mitigate abuse.

---

## 5. Use of Untrusted Data in Logic

- **Description:** The script trusts all records and properties retrieved from the database (`aktifNobetci`, `hedefNobetci`, `shiftTimeRanges`, etc.) without checks on data integrity or ownership. For instance, the code directly uses `hedefNobetci.id` and `user.telegram_id` for critical actions.

- **Risk:** If attackers (or compromised upstream data) manipulate the database, this could lead to privilege escalation, notification leak, or denial of service.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Validate the integrity and source of all data read from persistent storage.
  - Implement authorization checks where appropriate.

---

## 6. Time Zone and Locale in Logging

- **Description:** All log timestamps use `toLocaleString('tr-TR', { timeZone: 'Europe/Istanbul' })`. If attackers can influence locale or time zone settings, logs can be obfuscated or manipulated.

- **Risk:** Potential log obfuscation, confusion during incident response.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Consider logging in ISO 8601 format (UTC) for unambiguous timestamps.
  - Prevent modification of time zone/locale by untrusted sources.

---

## 7. Lack of Rate Limiting / Abuse Prevention

- **Description:** Cron jobs process all actions in one go (sending messages to all users, updating credits, etc.) without checking for abuse, resource exhaustion, or DoS mitigation.

- **Risk:** Exploitation of scheduled tasks for resource exhaustion attacks.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Introduce limits on the number of iterations or actions performed in each cron execution.
  - Monitor for abuse and anomalous upticks in processing.

## Final Notes

This review is based **only** on the code provided and assumes the behaviors of modules like `db` and `telegram_bot_handler` as described. For a comprehensive security assessment, review of those modules and their dependencies is also required.

**Action:** Address the issues above to improve the security posture of the cron jobs service.

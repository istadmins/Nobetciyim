# Security Vulnerability Report: Dockerfile

This report analyzes the provided Dockerfile for security vulnerabilities and potential risks that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the resulting containerized application.

---

## 1. Use of Root User (Default User)

**Description:**  
The base image (`node:18-alpine3.18`) runs as root by default. Running containers as root can increase the impact of a compromised container, allowing attackers to escalate privileges or access sensitive host resources.

**Potential Vulnerability:**
- Privilege escalation within the container.
- Threat actors gaining elevated access to the host system.

**Recommendation:**  
Add a non-root user and switch to it:
```dockerfile
RUN adduser -D appuser
USER appuser
```

---

## 2. Unpinned Package Versions

**Description:**  
Both Node.js and system dependencies are installed without explicit version pinning (other than the specific base image tag).

**Potential Vulnerability:**
- You may pull newer versions with unknown vulnerabilities.
- Builds may become unreliable or insecure if upstream packages become compromised or update unexpectedly.

**Recommendation:**  
Explicitly specify versions of system packages where possible. Consider base image tags with digest for added immutability.

---

## 3. Use of `dumb-init`

**Description:**  
`dumb-init` is installed via `apk add`, but not validated for authenticity or version.

**Potential Vulnerability:**
- If the package repository is compromised, a malicious version could be installed.
- `dumb-init` should always be installed from a trusted source. While Alpine repositories are generally safe, supply chain attacks have occurred elsewhere.

**Recommendation:**  
Only install minimal necessary packages. Consider verifying package signatures or hashes if possible.

---

## 4. Healthcheck HTTP Request to Localhost

**Description:**  
The healthcheck exposes an HTTP endpoint (`/health`) on port 80.

**Potential Vulnerability:**  
- If the health endpoint is not secured (e.g., if it reveals sensitive diagnostic info or evaluates potentially harmful queries), it may be exploited.
- Health endpoints should not leak secrets or sensitive internals.

**Recommendation:**  
Ensure the `/health` endpoint only exposes minimal health information and does not accept user input or reveal sensitive data.

---

## 5. No Removal of Sensitive Build Artifacts

**Description:**  
Thereâ€™s no explicit cleanup of possible artifacts (e.g., unintended files) after the `COPY . .` step.

**Potential Vulnerability:**  
- Code or credentials accidentally left in the build context may be included in the image.
- Files such as `.env`, test fixtures, or configuration files could be inadvertently copied.

**Recommendation:**  
.  
Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files from the build context.

---

## 6. Absence of Dependency Scanning

**Description:**  
The Dockerfile installs production dependencies with `npm install --only=production` but does not check for known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.

**Potential Vulnerability:**  
- Vulnerable third-party packages may be included.
- No automated alert for newly discovered CVEs.

**Recommendation:**  
Incorporate an npm audit step in your CI/CD:  
```bash
npm audit --production
```
Or, scan the final image with tools like Snyk, Trivy, or Grype.

---

## 7. Node.js Version Lifecycle

**Description:**  
Node.js version `18` is used. When Node.js 18 reaches end-of-life (EOL), it will no longer receive security updates.

**Potential Vulnerability:**  
- Outdated runtime environments are common attack vectors.

**Recommendation:**  
Monitor Node.js support timelines and upgrade before EOL.

---

## 8. Database File Location

**Description:**  
A `data` directory is created, potentially for SQLite.

**Potential Vulnerability:**  
- Database files stored in an unprotected directory inside the container may be exposed if a container is compromised.
- If container images are shared or published, the build context should exclude actual data.

**Recommendation:**  
Never include actual data in build contexts, and use dedicated volumes for database persistence.

# Summary Table

| Issue                        | Risk Level | Recommendation   |
|------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| Runs as root                 | High       | Use non-root user|
| Unpinned package versions    | Medium     | Pin versions     |
| Package supply chain         | Medium     | Validate packages|
| Health endpoint exposure     | Medium     | Harden endpoint  |
| Sensitive artifacts in image | High       | Use .dockerignore|
| Dependency vulnerabilities   | High       | Use audit/scans  |
| Node.js EOL                  | High       | Update regularly |
| Database file exposure       | Medium     | Use volumes      |

# Final Recommendations

- Add a `.dockerignore` file.
- Avoid running as root (add `USER` statement).
- Enable dependency and image scanning in your CI/CD pipeline.
- Pin all package versions where possible.
- Scrutinize exposed endpoints for sensitive output.
- Monitor base image and runtime for upstream CVEs and EOL.

**Addressing the above will significantly decrease the attack surface of your containerized Node.js application.**

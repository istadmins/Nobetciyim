# Security Vulnerability Report

## Analyzed Code

The provided code appears to be a `.env` style configuration file for a Node.js application. It contains sensitive information related to ports, JWT, database, email, Telegram bot, API tokens, and rate limiting.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Exposure of Sensitive Secrets in Source Code

**Vulnerability:**
- The `.env` file includes sensitive information such as `JWT_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`, and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
- If this file is inadvertently pushed to source control or otherwise exposed, it could lead to severe security breaches, such as unauthorized access and impersonation.

**Recommendation:**
- Add the `.env` file to `.gitignore`.
- Set secrets through environment variables on the server/CI environment and keep them out of versioned code.

---

### 2. Weak JWT Secret

**Vulnerability:**
- `JWT_SECRET` is set to a preset value: `your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-to-something-very-secure-and-random`.
- If unchanged, this predictable value could allow attackers to forge or manipulate JWTs.

**Impact:**  
Anyone with access to the secret can generate valid JWT tokens, compromising authentication.

**Recommendation:**
- Use a strong, randomly generated secret (32+ bytes).
- Regularly rotate secrets and never use default/example values in production.

---

### 3. Insecure Internal API Token

**Vulnerability:**
- `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` is hardcoded and present in plaintext.
- If this token is leaked, any attacker can leverage internal APIs with full privileges.

**Recommendation:**
- Store the token securely (e.g., environment secrets manager).
- Rotate the token periodically.
- Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as mutual TLS or identity federation.

---

### 4. Telegram Bot Token Exposure

**Vulnerability:**
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is in plaintext and may be deployed with this value.
- Anyone who obtains this token can control the bot, impersonate it, or access its conversations.

**Recommendation:**
- Keep bot tokens secret and do not store them in versioned config files.
- Regenerate the token if it leaks.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults to inject secrets at runtime.

---

### 5. Use of Default HTTP Port (Potential for Accidental Expo/Production Exposure)

**Vulnerability:**
- `PORT=80` configures the server to run on port 80, the default HTTP port.
- If `NODE_ENV` is not correctly set for production, or if this service runs publicly, it may be accessible to the internet during development with reduced security.

**Recommendation:**
- Restrict access to development servers at the firewall/network layer.
- Never run development environments exposed to the public internet.
- Always use HTTPS in production.

---

### 6. Development Environment Indicator

**Vulnerability:**
- `NODE_ENV=development` is set, which typically enables debug or verbose logging, reduced security checks, and other unsafe behaviors for the purpose of local development and testing.
- If this is ever left set in production, it broadens the attack surface.

**Recommendation:**
- Always set `NODE_ENV=production` for production deployments.
- Use secure, hardened configurations in all non-development deployments.

---

### 7. Insufficient Rate Limiting for Critical Endpoints

**Vulnerability:**
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100` over `900,000 ms (15 minutes)` may not be sufficient for protection against brute-force or DDoS attacks, especially on login/signup endpoints.
- The effectiveness depends on endpoint, sensitivity, and actual code logic.

**Recommendation:**
- Set lower rate limits for sensitive actions such as login, password reset, and API token usage.
- Consider per-user/IP rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

---

### 8. Weak Password Hashing Rounds (Context-dependent)

**Observation:**
- `BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12` is currently secure, but will become weaker over time as hardware improves.
- Lower values may become vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

**Recommendation:**
- Monitor recommended bcrypt rounds and update accordingly (currently, 12 is considered safe).
- Store and update hash rounds as part of a future upgrade plan.

---

## General Recommendations

- **Never commit secrets to version control.** Implement a process for secret management.
- **Use environment-specific configurations** and protect `.env` files.
- **Use dedicated secrets management systems** (e.g., Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- **Harden development and production environments** differently and isolate them.
- **Educate all developers** about secure handling of credentials and tokens.

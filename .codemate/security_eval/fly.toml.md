# Security Vulnerability Report for `fly.toml` (nobetciyim Node.js Application)

This report outlines potential security vulnerabilities detected in your provided `fly.toml` configuration **(for a Fly.io deployment)**. The review focuses **exclusively** on security issues as they relate to exposed configuration.

---

## 1. **Insecure Environment Setting**

- **Issue:**  
  ```toml
  NODE_ENV = 'development'
  ```
  Running your application in `development` mode can:
  - Expose verbose error messages and stack traces to users, potentially leaking sensitive information.
  - Disable performance and security features (e.g., in frameworks like Express, secure headers, caching, production-hardening middleware).
  
- **Recommendation:**  
  Ensure `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` before deploying to production environments.  
  ```toml
  NODE_ENV = 'production'
  ```

---

## 2. **Service Running on Port 80**

- **Issue:**  
  ```toml
  PORT = '80'
  internal_port = 80
  ```
  The application is exposed on port 80 (HTTP). Even though `force_https = true` is enabled, initial requests may be received in plaintext. If `force_https` is misconfigured or disabled in the future, traffic (including cookies or sensitive data) may traverse unencrypted.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Verify strict HTTPS enforcement at all layers (app and proxy).
  - Ideally, the application should listen internally on a non-standard port (e.g. 3000), and only the proxy should handle HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.  
  - Ensure that there is **no way to access the app directly over plain HTTP bypassing HTTPS enforcement**.

---

## 3. **Potentially Unsafe File System Mounts**

- **Issue:**  
  ```toml
  [mounts]
  source = "vnobetci"
  destination = "/app/data"
  ```
  Persistent volumes mounted to containers can cause:
  - Sensitive data leakage if files in `/app/data` are inadequately protected.
  - Potential elevation of privilege or code execution if untrusted files/scripts are loaded from this mount.

- **Recommendations:**  
  - Ensure that only necessary files are stored in `/app/data`.
  - Apply strict file permissions (least privilege principle).
  - Consider isolating sensitive and executable files.
  - Ensure your application validates and sanitizes all data read from this mount point.

---

## 4. **No Mention of Secret Management**

- **Issue:**  
  There's no explicit handling or reference to environment secrets (API keys, credentials, etc.) in the configuration.

- **Risk:**  
  If secrets were to be added directly to the `[env]` section, they could be unintentionally committed to version control or exposed to unauthorized users.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Use Fly.io's [secrets management](https://fly.io/docs/reference/secrets/) (`fly secrets set ...`) for all sensitive configuration, rather than storing credentials in `fly.toml`.
  - Audit your deployment scripts and environment for secrets in plaintext.

---

## 5. **Auto Stop Machines Disabled**

- **Issue:**  
  ```toml
  auto_stop_machines = 'off'
  ```
  While not a direct security risk, note that auto-stopping is disabled. This could:
  - Increase the attack surface if unused machines remain running.
  - Increase costs.

---

## 6. **Health Check Endpoint Exposure**

- **Issue:**  
  ```toml
  path = "/health"
  ```
  If the `/health` endpoint discloses too much information (e.g., debug data, service versions), it may aid attackers.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Ensure the `/health` endpoint returns minimal, non-sensitive status (e.g., just HTTP 200 OK).

| Vulnerability                        | Risk / Impact                                                  | Recommendation                                 |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `NODE_ENV="development"`             | Debug information leakage, weaker security defaults           | Use `NODE_ENV="production"`                    |
| Exposure on port 80                   | Possible plaintext transport, risk if HTTPS is disabled       | Strict HTTPS, app port isolation               |
| File system mounts                   | Sensitive data leakage, code execution                        | Restrict mounts, validate input, set perms     |
| No secret management                 | Credentials leakage if in config                              | Use dedicated secrets management               |
| Health check info disclosure         | System information leakage                                    | Minimal/standard healthcheck output            |

# **Remediation Steps**

1. **Always deploy with `NODE_ENV=production`.**
2. **Double-check that all traffic must use HTTPS.**
3. **Restrict what is written to or loaded from volume mounts.**
4. **Never keep secrets inside `fly.toml`; use secrets management instead.**
5. **Review endpoint implementations (/health, others) to avoid information leakage.**

> **Note:** No direct vulnerabilities related to code injection, insecure dependencies, or bad access control are visible here, as the configuration is architectural. Application-level vulnerabilities depend on your source code and broader Fly.io setup.  
>  
> **Review all deployment configs before going live.**

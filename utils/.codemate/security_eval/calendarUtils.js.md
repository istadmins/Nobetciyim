# Security Vulnerability Report for `calendarUtils.js`

This security report only lists **security vulnerabilities** discovered through a review of the provided code, focusing exclusively on exposure to security threats rather than general coding or logic errors.

## 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability

**Description:**  
The code invokes methods on the `db` object with SQL queries and external parameters. Most importantly, parameters appear to be injected safely using the SQLite placeholder (`?`) and passing values as arrays. However, without the underlying `db` object's implementation, it is not possible to confirm whether every data source is sufficiently protected.

**Example:**
```js
db.all("SELECT id, name, telegram_id FROM Nobetciler ORDER BY id ASC", [], ... );
db.get("SELECT ayar_value FROM uygulama_ayarlari WHERE ayar_key = 'resort_config'", [], ... );
```
These themselves are safe **if and only if** no user data can be injected into the SQL statement directly. If any query construction concatenates user inputs into SQL, it would become a SQL injection risk.

**Assessment:**  
- Provided code **does not construct SQL with concatenation**, so *as shown*, no SQLi vulnerability here.
- **Unverifiable:** The third-party functions like `db.getDutyOverride(yil, haftaNo)` and `db.getNobetciById(...)` are called with values that may originate from user input. If the underlying implementation is not using parameterized queries, there could be hidden SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:**  
- Verify that all `db` methods use strict parameterization.
- Audit all database helper functions (`db.js`) to confirm no user-controlled input is directly injected into SQL.

## 2. Insecure JSON Parse (Potential Denial of Service/Eval Risk)

**Description:**  
The code parses values from the database using `JSON.parse()` directly.

```js
try {
    resolve(JSON.parse(row.ayar_value));
} catch (parseError) {
    // error handling
}
```
**Assessment:**  
- While `JSON.parse` itself is not code-eval, unvalidated, untrusted JSON from a database could cause a crash (if very large or malformed â€“ denial-of-service), and if any *dynamic code execution* is later used, this could escalate.
- However, as written, the code falls back to default config on error, mitigating DoS risk for an individual bad row.

**Recommendation:**  
- Make sure only trusted administrators can insert or update these configuration values.
- Log parsing errors for monitoring.

## 3. Information Leakage via Error Messages

**Description:**  
The code logs potentially sensitive error messages to the console:

```js
console.error("DB Error (getAllNobetcilerFromDB):", err.message);
console.error("DB Error (getResortConfigFromDB):", err.message);
console.error("[getAsilHaftalikNobetci] Fonksiyonunda hata:", error.message, error.stack);
```

**Assessment:**
- If running in production or in a user-facing environment, detailed error messages (including stack traces and database error messages) can leak implementation details or data to an attacker (if not strictly kept out of view).
- There is no indication that logs are filtered in production. Excess verbosity can be dangerous.

**Recommendation:**
- In production, sanitize error output (do not output stack traces or raw DB error messages).
- Consider logging errors to a secure audit log with strict access controls.

---

## 4. Data Exposure through Predictable IDs

**Description:**  
When returning user records (such as duty officers), the code exposes internal database identifiers and Telegram IDs.

```js
return { id: asilNobetci.id, name: asilNobetci.name, telegram_id: asilNobetci.telegram_id };
```

**Assessment:**
- If this function is exposed to untrusted clients (through a bot or API), leaking internal IDs and Telegram IDs could facilitate enumeration or targeted attacks against users.

**Recommendation:**
- Only expose the data that is actually necessary for external consumers.
- Mask or omit internal IDs and sensitive identifiers if not strictly needed.

---

## 5. Handling of Unexpected Values

**Description:**  
External values (dates, inputs) could potentially cause unexpected behavior, but the code resets date times and checks array bounds.

**Assessment:**  
- No direct vulnerability visible here regarding arbitrary code execution or memory corruption.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement validation on any externally provided dates or indices to avoid logic bugs, but not a direct security vulnerability as written.

| Vulnerability                | Risk                         | Present in Code? | Recommendation                                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| SQL Injection                | Data exfiltration, RCE       | Not directly     | Review all `db.js` methods for param. protection   |
| Insecure JSON.parse          | DoS, application crash       | Possible         | Restrict database writes, monitor errors           |
| Information Leakage          | Recon/Implementation leak    | Present          | Sanitize production logs                           |
| Data Exposure (IDs etc)      | User enumeration, targeting  | Present          | Limit data in API responses                        |

# Final Recommendations

- **Review all database helper implementations** for parameter safety and input sanitization.
- **Sanitize all error output** for production deployments.
- **Restrict sensitive data** exposure to only what is necessary.
- **Restrict who can alter configuration** in the DB and monitor for malicious/incorrect changes.
- **Regularly audit logs and database contents** for anomalies.

**Note:**  
No critical vulnerabilities were found within the direct code present, but the overall security posture strongly depends on the implementation security of the `db.js` library and how this module is exposed to end-users or other systems. Further review of those layers is recommended.

# Code Review Report

## General

The code demonstrates an implementation for initializing a Winston-based logger with file transport and conditional console logging for non-production environments. Below is a line-by-line review for adherence to industry standards, potential bugs, improvements for clarity, performance, and maintainability. Suggestions are given in pseudo code format.

## Issues & Recommendations

### 1. Directory Creation: Error Handling

**Issue**:  
The `fs.mkdirSync` call does not handle potential errors (e.g., permissions issue, race conditions if multiple processes try to create the directory simultaneously), and `fs.existsSync` is a synchronous check, which is generally discouraged in production or asynchronous environments such as Node.js.

**Recommendation**:  
Use `fs.promises` for creating directories asynchronously and handle errors appropriately.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**
```js
// Replace with asynchronous version and proper error handling
await fs.promises.mkdir(logsDir, { recursive: true }).catch((err) => {
  // Handle/log error appropriately
});
```

### 2. Log File Rotations: Use of Winston-Daily-Rotate-File

**Issue**:  
Current approach relies on `maxsize` and `maxFiles`, but this does not handle date-based log rotation, which is often the industry standard for operational environments.

**Recommendation**:  
Consider using [`winston-daily-rotate-file`](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston-daily-rotate-file) for time-based log file rotation for better log management.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**
```js
// Example: Use winston-daily-rotate-file
new DailyRotateFile({
  filename: path.join(logsDir, 'error-%DATE%.log'),
  datePattern: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  level: 'error'
}),
```

---

### 3. Hardcoded Service Name

**Issue**:  
`defaultMeta: { service: 'nobetciyim' }` is hardcoded, which reduces reusability and flexibility.

**Recommendation**:  
Make the service name configurable through an environment variable or configuration file.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**
```js
defaultMeta: { service: process.env.SERVICE_NAME || 'nobetciyim' },
```

---

### 4. Console Transport Formatting Inconsistency

**Issue**:  
Console logs use a different format (`colorize()` and `simple()`) than file logs (`json`). This can make debugging inconsistent.

**Recommendation**:  
Consider using the same format for both console and file for consistency, or at least ensure both contain the same information.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**
```js
// Option 1: Use the same format as files
format: logFormat
// Option 2: Add timestamp to console format for parity
winston.format.combine(
  winston.format.colorize(),
  winston.format.timestamp({ format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' }),
  winston.format.simple()
)
```

---

### 5. Missing Logger Close Mechanism

**Issue**:  
No mechanism is provided to flush/close logger on app shutdown, potentially resulting in data loss in crash scenarios.

**Recommendation**:  
Expose a `close` function or handle process signals for graceful shutdown.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**
```js
// Pseudo: Ensure logger transports are closed on process exit
process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  logger.end();  // or logger.close() if available
  process.exit(0);
});
```

---

### 6. Module Exports

**Issue**:  
The code exports only the logger instance, which may limit future extensibility (e.g., access to the logs directory or log configuration).

**Recommendation**:  
Consider exporting an object with `logger`, `logsDir`, or other utility methods.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**
```js
module.exports = { logger, logsDir };
```

---

### 7. Unhandled Transports Errors

**Issue**:  
No event listeners are added for `error` events on the transportsâ€”logging errors (e.g., log file not writable) may be silently ignored.

**Recommendation**:  
Attach error listeners to transports.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**
```js
logger.on('error', (err) => {
  // Handle/log the error appropriately
});
```

# auth.js - High-Level Documentation

This file provides client-side authentication utility functions for a web application. Its main responsibilities include:

- **Token Presence Validation**: Contains a function (`checkToken`) that verifies whether a user authentication token exists in the browser's local storage. If the token is absent, the user is redirected to the login page, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected content.

- **Logout Handling**: Provides a function (`handleLogout`) to facilitate the logout process. This function removes the authentication token from local storage and redirects the user to the login page, effectively ending the user's authenticated session.

Integration with the page lifecycle and event handling is performed elsewhere (e.g., in `main.js`), keeping this file focused solely on authentication logic and related utilities.

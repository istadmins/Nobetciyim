# Security Vulnerability Report

This document analyzes the provided JavaScript code (`calendar.js`) for **security vulnerabilities only**. The review is based on best practices and known attack methods related to security in web applications.

---

## 1. Insecure Storage and Transmission of Authentication Token

**Code:**  
Usage of `localStorage.getItem('token')` for JWT or Bearer token in all API requests.

```js
headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('token') }
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- Storing sensitive tokens (such as JWT) in `localStorage` is inherently insecure, as JavaScript running on the page (including third-party scripts or XSS payloads) can access these tokens.  
- If XSS is present anywhere on the origin, an attacker can steal these tokens.
- The tokens are also sent with every request via JavaScript, which could expose them to unintended receivers in the case of scripts making requests to unexpected endpoints.

**Mitigation:**  
- Use Secure, SameSite cookies set by the server for storing authentication tokens instead of `localStorage`.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.

## 2. Risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Editable Content

**Code:**  
Enabling direct editing of cell content through `contenteditable="true"`:

```js
remarkCell.setAttribute('contenteditable', 'true');
remarkCell.textContent = haftalikVeri ? haftalikVeri.aciklama : "";
...
remarkCell.addEventListener('blur', async (e) => {
    // ...
    await saveTakvimData(yil, hafta, {
        aciklama: e.target.textContent.trim(),
        ...
    });
});
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- Any input entered into the remark cell (including arbitrary HTML/js script tags) is directly assigned to `.textContent` and then persisted via `saveTakvimData`.
- If this `aciklama` field is later rendered on any page as HTML (ex: via `.innerHTML`), this creates an XSS vector.

**Mitigation:**  
- Sanitize all user input (especially anything editable/entered) on both client and server.
- Never inject user-supplied content into the DOM via `.innerHTML` without escaping.
- Consider restricting or stripping HTML tags from remarks.
- Prefer using `.textContent` for insertion, not `.innerHTML`.

## 3. Untrusted Data in JSON Handling (Drag-and-Drop)

**Code:**  
Parsing potentially manipulated JSON from drag events:

```js
const data = e.dataTransfer.getData('application/json');
if (data) {
    localDraggedItemInfo = JSON.parse(data);
}
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- An attacker with local JavaScript access (via browser console or malicious extension) could simulate drag-and-drop events with malicious payloads, potentially manipulating logic or causing errors if the app is not defensively coded.
- This attack surface is limited, but unsafe usage of unvalidated/untrusted JSON objects can lead to logic issues or even reflected XSS if not handled carefully.

**Mitigation:**  
- Strictly validate the JSON object structure and values after parsing before further use.
- Catch and handle parsing errors robustly.
- Do not rely on client-supplied drag-and-drop data for any trusted decisions or server state.

---

## 4. use of `prompt`, `alert`, `confirm` for User Interaction

**Code:**
```js
const kullaniciSecimiStr = prompt(secimMesaji);
...
if (confirm(`'${secilenNobetciAdi}' adlı nöbetçi...`)) {
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- While these functions themselves are not a direct vector for code injection, they do create a UI/UX surface where social engineering might be used.
- If any variable interpolated into the prompt/alert/confirm strings is derived from untrusted input, it could mislead users or even cause phishing via UI redress.

**Mitigation:**  
- Escape and sanitize any user-derived data included in `prompt`, `alert`, or `confirm` dialog content.

---

## 5. Insufficient Error Handling and Logging of Sensitive Data

**Code:**
```js
catch (error) { console.error("Takvim verisi kaydedilirken hata:", error); ... }
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- If detailed error objects or messages are logged to the front-end console, and contain sensitive data (such as full request/response objects), it could potentially expose information about the application internals or sensitive data structures to a local user or anyone with access to browser developer tools.

**Mitigation:**  
- When logging to the client console, avoid including sensitive data.
- Consider logging only non-sensitive information (error type, basic status) or removing logs in production builds.

---

## 6. No CSRF Protections (Assumed, based on Client-Side Only Review)

**Scenario:**  
- All requests are sent with Bearer tokens in the Authorization header.
- If the server-side API validates only the token and does not additionally check CSRF tokens or user intent/referer, and if the token is compromised (via XSS etc.), server actions could occur via forged requests.

**Mitigation:**  
- Implement CSRF protections at the API level.
- Use additional CSRF tokens (in cookies or headers), and validate origin and referer headers.

---

## 7. No Input Validation on Client (and Possibly Server)

**Code:**  
- User input entered via prompt (nobetci index).
- Free-form text in remark cells.

**Vulnerability:**  
- Lack of client-side validation enables attackers (or misinformed users) to enter invalid data, which, if inadequately validated on the server, may lead to server-side vulnerabilities, data corruption, or even injection attacks.

**Mitigation:**  
- Validate all input on BOTH client- and server-side for type, range, allowed values, and length.
- Always treat client data as untrusted.

## **Overall Security Recommendations**

- **Move away from `localStorage` for sensitive tokens.**
- **Thoroughly sanitize all user input** before storage or display.
- **Validate all interactive data** (drag-and-drop, user selections, form fields).
- **Implement CSP headers** and use secure cookies.
- **Review server-side code** for corresponding validation, sanitization, and authentication/authorization.
- **Remove or restrict sensitive client-side logging** for production environments.

**Note:**  
Without knowledge of how remarks, holidays, and other user-editable data are rendered on other parts of the site (or the server validation/sanitization logic), this report cannot guarantee the absence of XSS or other client-side attacks. All output-sensitive and storage-sensitive operations should be reviewed for robust input/output validation and encoding.

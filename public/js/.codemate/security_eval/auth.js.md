# Security Vulnerability Report for auth.js

## Overview

This report analyzes potential security vulnerabilities found in the provided JavaScript authentication code. The code utilizes `localStorage` to store authentication tokens on the client side and includes token checks and logout logic.

---

## Vulnerabilities

### 1. Storing Authentication Token in `localStorage`
**Description**:  
The code saves the user's authentication token in `localStorage`:
```js
localStorage.getItem('token')
localStorage.removeItem('token');
```
**Risks**:
- **XSS Vulnerability**: If the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), an attacker can run arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, allowing them to access and exfiltrate the token from `localStorage`.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tokens in `localStorage` persist across browser sessions, even after the browser is closed, increasing the risk window.

**Recommended Remediation**:
- **Use HttpOnly Cookies**: Store sensitive tokens (e.g., JWTs) in HttpOnly, Secure cookies, which are inaccessible to JavaScript. This significantly reduces the risk from XSS.
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure that all user input is sanitized and that XSS vulnerabilities are mitigated throughout the application.

### 2. No Token Expiration Handling on Client
**Description**:  
The logout/check mechanism relies only on the presence of a string in `localStorage`.  
**Risks**:
- **Replay Attacks & Session Hijacking**: If a token is stolen, it may be used indefinitely if there is no expiration or invalidation logic client-side or server-side.

**Recommended Remediation**:
- Ensure tokens are short-lived and the backend checks expiration/invalidates tokens appropriately.
- Consider periodically clearing tokens from the client and re-authenticating users.

---

### 3. Lack of Token Integrity or Verification (Client-side)
**Description**:  
The `checkToken` function only verifies the existence of a value called 'token' in `localStorage`, not its validity.  
**Risks**:
- **Client-side manipulation**: Attackers can modify or insert any value into `localStorage`, possibly bypassing minimal client-side checks.

**Recommended Remediation**:
- Always validate the token server-side before granting access to protected resources; do not trust client-side checks for authentication or authorization.

---

### 4. Information Leakage via Redirection
**Description**:  
Both functions redirect to `login.html` if the token is missing or being removed.
**Risks**:
- **Open Redirection**: While not directly exploitable in provided code, if any URL parameters become involved, ensure they are sanitized to avoid open redirect vulnerabilities.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability             | Severity | Remediation                      |
|-------------------------- |----------|-----------------------------------|
| `localStorage` for tokens | High     | Use HttpOnly, Secure cookies      |
| No token expiration (client) | Medium  | Use short-lived tokens; revalidate|
| No integrity/verification | Medium   | Always validate server-side       |
| Redirection risks         | Low      | Sanitize redirect targets         |

---

## General Recommendations

- Do **not** store sensitive tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
- Use Secure, HttpOnly cookies for tokens.
- Always validate tokens on the backend. Never trust the presence of a token client-side as proof of authentication.
- Protect your application from XSS vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper session expiration and logout handling.

**Note**: These vulnerabilities are common in front-end authentication patterns. The most critical risk is the use of `localStorage` for authentication tokens. Fixing this should be the highest priority.

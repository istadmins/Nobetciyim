# Security Vulnerability Report

**File analyzed:** `public/js/zamanKrediIslemleri.js`  
**Scope:** *Only security vulnerabilities or security-relevant issues detected in this JavaScript code.*

## 1. DOM-based XSS – Use of `innerHTML` with Untrusted Data

### Issue

Throughout the code, the method `innerHTML` is used to write HTML content into the DOM, and at least in `zamanKrediTablosunuDoldur`, it includes values that come from external sources (`satir.kredi_dakika`, `satir.baslangic_saat`, `satir.bitis_saat` coming from an API). For example:

```js
tr.innerHTML = `
  <td><input type="number" class="kredi-dakika-input form-control" min="0" value="${satir.kredi_dakika}"></td>
  <td>
    <input type="time" class="baslangic-saat form-control" value="${satir.baslangic_saat}">
    -
    <input type="time" class="bitis-saat form-control" value="${satir.bitis_saat}">
  </td>
  <td>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-sm" onclick="removeTimeRow(this.parentNode.parentNode)"><i class="fa fa-trash"></i></button>
  </td>
</tr>
`;
```

Even when you expect a backend to output only trusted data, attackers may find ways to inject malicious values if the API is not well sanitized or is attacker-controllable.

### Risk

- **High** – Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript payloads or manipulate DOM, leading to client-side XSS.

### Recommendation

- **Never** interpolate untrusted data directly into `innerHTML`. Prefer DOM APIs (e.g., `document.createElement()`, `setAttribute()`), or sanitize data strictly before injecting.
- If you must use `innerHTML`, escape any dynamic content, or use trusted libraries designed to prevent XSS (e.g., DOMPurify).

## 2. Use of `localStorage` for Sensitive Tokens

### Issue

The code stores and retrieves a Bearer token using `localStorage`:

```js
headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('token') }
```

### Risk

- **High** – Tokens in `localStorage` are accessible by any JavaScript running on the page, including third-party libraries and malicious scripts introduced via XSS. This exposes tokens to theft and session hijacking.

### Recommendation

- **Use HttpOnly cookies** for storing authentication tokens. HttpOnly cookies are not accessible by JavaScript, greatly limiting XSS impact.
- If you must use `localStorage`, ensure the application is strictly free of all XSS vulnerabilities.

## 3. Use of `onclick` Inline Event Handler Attributes

### Issue

The code adds event handlers using the inline `onclick` attribute inside HTML generated via `innerHTML`:

```js
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-sm" onclick="removeTimeRow(this.parentNode.parentNode)">
```

### Risk

- **Medium** – Inline event handlers with untrusted context or user-influenced event handler content can increase XSS risk and are harder to audit.
- **Additionally:** Inline handlers may bypass modern Content Security Policies (CSP) if not properly set.

### Recommendation

- Attach JavaScript event listeners using `addEventListener` after element creation, rather than via inline HTML attributes.
- Use strong CSP (`Content-Security-Policy`) headers to restrict inline script execution.

## 4. Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation for User-controlled Fields

### Issue

Inputs for number and time are only type-checked on the client side and minimally validated (e.g., check for empty, is a non-negative integer). However, there is no explicit input sanitization for what could become sent back to the server or used in dynamic HTML.

### Risk

- **Medium** – If input fields are not sanitized, malicious values could be set via the browser's dev tools, or via compromised endpoints, potentially enabling further injection or logic attacks.

### Recommendation

- Enforce strict type and range checks server-side, **never** trust client-side validation alone.
- Sanitize any data before reflecting it back into the DOM dynamically.

---

## 5. Insecure Use of `confirm()` and `alert()` for Critical Actions

### Issue

The code relies on the browser's built-in `confirm()` for deletion confirmation and `alert()` for important status messages.

### Risk

- **Low** – While not per se a vulnerability, using only `confirm()` could open up the ability for social engineering or click-jacking attacks if used in combination with other vulnerabilities.

### Recommendation

- Consider using custom modals with explicit UX for destructive operations, and avoid relying on native dialogs alone.

---

## 6. Minimal Error Handling May Leak Detailed Errors

### Issue

When receiving errors from the API, messages are sometimes rendered directly into the DOM, and detailed error information is reported in console logs.

### Risk

- **Low/Medium** – Information leakage: Attackers could harvest error messages for information about backend structure, though most are output only to the console.

### Recommendation

- Ensure error messages shown in the DOM/logs are generic and do not expose sensitive server or application details.

---

## 7. No Use of CSRF Protection

### Issue

API calls appear to rely solely on Bearer tokens for authentication. If the application is open to authenticated CSRF (e.g., via Bearer tokens in `localStorage` accessible in XSS scenarios), an attacker could steal a token and perform CSRF attacks.

### Risk

- **Medium/High** – Risk increases in XSS context, or if tokens could be otherwise compromised.

### Recommendation

- Use CSRF tokens in addition to authentication, or safeguard Bearer tokens (see point #2).

# Actionable Remediation

1. **Eliminate all direct `innerHTML` with untrusted data**; use DOM manipulation or trusted templates and sanitize all data.
2. **Move token storage to HttpOnly cookies** and enforce secure (HTTPS) connections.
3. **Do not use inline JS handlers**; wire up events programmatically after DOM insertions.
4. **Validate and sanitize inputs server-side** in addition to existing client-side controls.
5. **Harden error and confirmation UX.**
6. **Review for CSRF if tokens can be leaked or reused by another origin.**

---

**Summary:**  
This code, as currently written, exposes significant surface for DOM-based XSS, exposes Bearer tokens in `localStorage`, and has several areas where developer security hygiene should be improved. These issues should be addressed before deploying this code in a production environment.

## Key Components & Their Styling

### 1. **General Page Layout**
- Sets a consistent font, color, and spacing using a neutral background and readable text color.
- `.container` centralizes and constrains the main content for better readability.

### 2. **Header and Navigation**
- `header` features a dark background with white centered text.
- Navigation menu styled inline for desktop, block for mobile (responsive).
- Navigational links have a hover effect for improved usability.
- A logout button is styled distinctively (red) and positioned for visibility.

### 3. **Forms**
- Input sections for adding duty members and rules are highlighted using card-style backgrounds, rounded corners, and subtle shadows.
- Form inputs expand to available width with adequate padding and visual clarity.
- Buttons are styled for prominence and interactive feedback on hover.

### 4. **Tables**
- Used extensively throughout for listings (duty schedule, rules, etc.).
- Tables have full width, row striping, and hover highlights for increased user focus.
- Table cell spacing, borders, header emphasis, and responsive containers are applied.

### 5. **Calendar / Duty Schedule**
- Distinct component for visualizing or editing the duty schedule:
  - Responsive controls for navigating months/years.
  - Specialized cell stylings for current day, previous/next month days, weekends, user-defined holidays, and official holidays.
  - Tooltips, drag-and-drop support, and manual assignment indicators introduced for interactive use.
  
### 6. **Buttons**
- Action buttons (save, add row, start credit distribution) utilize color coding for differentiation and have prominent hover states.
- Consistent sizing, padding, and rounded borders for modern button aesthetics.

### 7. **Feedback Section**
- Dedicated styled area for displaying calculation results or messages to users, with attention-grabbing background color.

### 8. **Footer**
- A simple, sticky footer matching the header’s color theme for unified branding.

### 9. **Responsiveness (Mobile View)**
- Adjusted padding/margins, navigation stack, relocated buttons, and reflowed controls to ensure usability on smaller screens.

## 1. General Page Layout (`body.login-page`)
- Uses Flexbox to center the login form both vertically and horizontally.
- Sets a minimum height of 100% viewport and a green background color.
- Applies a modern sans-serif font family for consistency.

## 2. Login Container and Box
- `.login-container`: Centers the content within the available space.

## 4. Input Fields
- Styles text and password inputs with padding, subtle borders, rounded corners, and a soft background.
- Placeholder text is grayed for clarity.
- On focus, inputs get a colored border and a light box-shadow matching the page theme.

## 5. Login Button
- `.login-button`: Styles the submission button with a prominent green color, padding, bold uppercase text, and hover effect for interactivity.

## 6. Message Areas
- `.message-area`: Generic styling for alerts and feedback messages, with padding, border, and rounded corners.
- `.error-message` and `.success-message`: Distinguishes error and success feedback with themed background and border colors.

## 7. Additional Links

# Security Vulnerability Report

## Target

**File:** [Provided HTML for "Nöbetçi Yönetim Sistemi" Web Interface]  
**Review Scope:** Identification and description of **security vulnerabilities** only.  
**Assumptions:**  
- Only HTML is provided, but it references local and remote resources, including several JavaScript files.
- No server-side code is shown.
- All JavaScript logic, API endpoints (if any), and backend processing are **out of scope** but inferred for some risks.

---

## 1. Client-Side Only Validation

**Location:**  
Several `<form>` elements (`nobetciEkleForm`, `kuralEkleForm`) rely exclusively on HTML5 validation attributes (such as `required`, `type="number"`, `min="0"`).

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Client-side validation can be bypassed:** Attackers may submit requests directly (e.g., via curl or browser dev tools), bypassing required fields or types.
- Malicious data can potentially reach backend if server-side validation is not enforced.
- Risks include injection attacks (SQL, script, etc.), invalid data insertion, and unauthorized access.

**Recommendation:**  
- Always implement strict server-side input validation and sanitization.
- Never trust client-supplied values.

---

## 2. Password Handling

**Location:**  
```html
<label for="password">Şifre:</label>
<input type="text" id="password" name="password" class="form-control" placeholder="Şifre" required />
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Password field uses `type="text"`** instead of `type="password"`. Entered password will be visible on screen, in browser history, and possibly in JS logs.
- **Exposes users to shoulder-surfing and accidental leaks.**
- If stored insecurely or transmitted in plaintext (not shown), risks increase.

**Recommendation:**  
- Change to `<input type="password" ... >`.
- Always use HTTPS on all pages, especially those handling credentials.

---

## 3. Content Injection and XSS Potential

**Location:**  
- Dynamic population of table bodies via JavaScript: `<tbody id="nobetciTableBody">`, `<tbody>`, etc.
- No evidence of output encoding or sanitization in displayed data.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **If user-supplied data (names, phone numbers, descriptions, etc) is rendered without escaping, application is vulnerable to DOM XSS attacks.**
- Example: If a user inputs `<script>alert(1)</script>` as a name, it could be executed client-side.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure all data injected into the DOM is properly HTML-encoded.
- Sanitize user-generated content both client- and server-side.
- Prefer libraries or frameworks that automatically escape data.

---

## 4. Use of External, Unpinned CSS (CDN)

**Location:**  
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Dependency on third-party CDN (cdnjs) exposes the page to risk if the CDN is compromised (dependency hijacking, MITM, etc).**
- No [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) checking is used.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use SRI to ensure integrity of external resources.  
  Example:  
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="..." integrity="sha384-..." crossorigin="anonymous">
  ```
- Where possible, host critical libraries locally.

---

## 5. No CSRF Protection Indicated

**Location:**  
- All forms (`nobetciEkleForm`, `kuralEkleForm`, etc.) submit data, likely via JavaScript.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **If backend does not verify origin or require valid CSRF tokens, application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).**
- Attackers could trick authenticated users into making unwanted changes.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement CSRF protection on the server-side for all state-changing operations.

---

## 6. No Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Location:**  
- No `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>` set in `<head>`.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Absence of CSP increases risk of XSS and data exfiltration.**
- Inline scripts, malicious resources, and data submission endpoints are unrestricted by policy.

**Recommendation:**  
- Set a restrictive CSP header to only allow trusted resources and block inline JavaScript by default.

---

## 7. Storage of Sensitive Data

**Location:**  
- Potentially sensitive information (passwords, Telegram IDs, phone numbers) is collected.

**Vulnerability:**  
- If data is not encrypted at rest or in transit, can lead to information leakage.
- No mention of GDPR or Turkish KVKK compliance (for personal data).

**Recommendation:**  
- Store sensitive information encrypted in databases.
- Always use HTTPS to protect data in transit.

---

## 8. Lack of Session Security Indicators

**Location:**  
- `logoutBtn` present, so authentication/authorization is implied, but no details shown.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **If authentication tokens (e.g., cookies, JWTs) are not protected by `HttpOnly` and `Secure` attributes, session hijacking is possible.**
- No info about session timeout or re-authentication upon privilege changes.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use strong, correctly-configured session management on the backend.
- Always set tokens as `HttpOnly` and `Secure`.

---

## 9. Inclusion of Untrusted Local Scripts

**Location:**  
```html
<script src="js/auth.js"></script>
<script src="js/hesaplama.js"></script>
<script src="js/nobetciIslemleri.js"></script>
<script src="js/kuralIslemleri.js"></script>
<script src="js/zamanKrediIslemleri.js"></script>
<script src="js/calendar.js"></script>
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```

**Vulnerability:**  
- **If these scripts are writable by users/attackers or not securely deployed, application is at risk of client-side compromise.**
- Any XSS vulnerability would allow local privilege escalation.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure local scripts are securely maintained and not writable or accessible by unauthorized users.

---

## 10. No Clickjacking Protection

**Location:**  
- No use of headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `frame-ancestors` in CSP.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Site could be iframed in malicious contexts (clickjacking)**

**Recommendation:**  
- Set appropriate headers to deny iframing:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - or in CSP: `frame-ancestors 'none';`

# Final Notes

- **The most critical risks** relate to input validation, XSS, insecure password handling, and lack of CSRF/CSP mitigations.
- **Many issues are not directly fixable in the HTML, but must be addressed in server-side or configuration layers.**
- **This review assumes backend and JavaScript logic do not already address these concerns**; confirm implementation accordingly.

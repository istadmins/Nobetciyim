# Security Vulnerability Report for `routes/nobetci.js`

---

## Overview

The code implements various Express.js routes for managing "nobetci" (duty personnel) objects stored presumably in an SQLite database. While it provides essential functionality, several security vulnerabilities are present, particularly regarding **authentication**, **authorization**, **input validation**, and **sensitive data management**. Below are the specific findings:

---

## Vulnerability List

### 1. **Lack of Authentication and Authorization**

**Description:**  
No user authentication (login, session, token) or authorization checks (roles, permissions) are implemented on any route. All API endpoints (including user creation, deletion, reset password, update operations) are publicly accessible and can be called by anyone with access to the API.

**Impact:**  
- Any user (including unauthenticated, external attackers) can:
  - List all users and personal data (`GET /`)
  - Create new users (`POST /`)
  - Delete users (`DELETE /:id`)
  - Reset passwords of any user (`POST /reset-password/:id`)
  - Update sensitive user fields (Telegram ID, phone, credits) for any user
  - Change the active "nobetci"

**Remediation:**  
- Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT, session-based authentication)
- Implement role-based access control (e.g., only admins can create/delete users, reset passwords)
- Apply authorization middleware to restrict all sensitive endpoints

---

### 2. **Sensitive Data Exposure**

**Description:**  
- The `GET /` endpoint returns sensitive user information such as `telegram_id`, `telefon_no`, credit info, and possibly even password hashes (if included elsewhere).
- The API responses and logs may expose new or reset passwords.

**Impact:**  
- Leaking personal information, credentials, and internal identifiers increases the risk of further attacks (phishing, spoofing, etc.).
- Passwords transferred in API responses or logs could be intercepted or found in log files.

**Remediation:**  
- **Never return passwords (or password hashes) in any API response**
- Avoid returning sensitive fields (such as phone numbers and telegram IDs) unless strictly necessary and only to authorized users
- Mask or redactsensitive info in logs
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all traffic (not shown in code, but ensure usage in deployment)

---

### 3. **Insecure Password Handling**

**Description:**  
- Passwords are stored in the database as plain values -- the password is passed directly from user input to the database in `POST /`, and resets in plaintext with `/reset-password/:id`.
- There is no evidence of password hashing or salting.

**Impact:**  
- Attacker with database access can retrieve all user passwords.
- If leaks occur (e.g., database backup is stolen), user credentials are compromised.

**Remediation:**  
- **Always hash passwords** using a strong hash function (bcrypt, Argon2, or at minimum, PBKDF2).
- Never store or log passwords in plaintext.
- On password reset, do not return the new password in the API response if avoidable; use secure methods (e.g., one-time links, or notify the user securely).

---

### 4. **SQL Injection Risk**

**Description:**  
- Most SQL queries use positional parameters (e.g., `?`) to prevent SQL injection in input values.
- However, the route parameters such as `req.params.id` are passed directly to the query in multiple places (e.g., update, delete, etc.), and there is **no input validation or sanitization**.
- While using parameterized queries helps, if the query building elsewhere isn't consistent, or for more complex queries, this may pose a risk.

**Impact:**  
- If at any place, string interpolation is used instead of parameterization, or if the SQL driver is not strict, attackers may inject SQL via manipulated IDs or fields.

**Remediation:**  
- Always validate/sanitize all input, especially route parameters (ensure `id` is integer and positive, validate shapes of all request bodies)
- Continue to use parameterized queries
- Use an ORM or query builder that enforces type-checking and prevents raw SQL injection

---

### 5. **No Rate Limiting or Brute-Force Protection**

**Description:**  
- Endpoints such as password reset and user creation are not protected against repeated abuse.

**Impact:**  
- Attackers may brute-force reset user passwords to gain access, or create many users as spam.
- Denial of service (resource exhaustion) is possible.

**Remediation:**  
- Implement API rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Apply anti-automation measures (e.g., CAPTCHA, IP blacklisting for abuse)

---

### 6. **Logging Sensitive Data**

**Description:**  
- The logger outputs the newly set password in logs on password reset.
- Other fields (names, phone numbers) are also logged.

**Impact:**  
- If log files are accessible to unauthorized users, sensitive credentials are leaked.
- Internal logs should avoid including PII or credentials.

**Remediation:**  
- Redact or mask sensitive fields (like passwords, phone numbers) in logs
- Centralize logging and restrict access to logs

---

### 7. **No Input Validation/Sanitization**

**Description:**  
- No schema validation of request bodies (e.g., in user creation, update, or credit update routes).
- The API accepts arbitrary data for critical fields, which may permit code/logic manipulation or application errors.

**Impact:**  
- Could allow XSS or injection attacks if input is used elsewhere
- Could break expected constraints (e.g., negative credits, invalid phone numbers)
- Raises risk of application errors and security vulnerabilities down the line

**Remediation:**  
- Use Joi, Yup, zod, or similar package to validate/sanitize all incoming request data and route params (types, bounds, constraints)

---

### 8. **Password Reset Mechanism is Insecure**

**Description:**  
- The password reset endpoint allows anyone who knows the user's numeric ID to reset their password.
- There is no verification (identity, admin privilege, etc.).
- Password is generated server-side and sent in the API response (possibly visible to anyone).

**Impact:**  
- Highly vulnerable to abuse: attacker can lock out or take over any account by guessing/iterating over IDs and resetting passwords.
- User may not be notified, leading to silent account takeover.

**Remediation:**  
- Restrict password reset to authenticated and authorized users only
- Implement additional verification (e.g., via email/SMS, admin approval, etc.)
- Do not expose newly generated passwords in the API response

## Recommendations

- Implement **robust authentication and session management**
- Apply **role-based access controls** (admins vs normal users)
- Store all passwords securely, use **hashing and salting**
- **Validate and sanitize** every input from external sources
- Limit and secure **logging** of sensitive information
- Protect all sensitive actions (**e.g., password reset, user update**) with proper authorization and verification
- Consider **rate-limiting** APIs prone to abuse

# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes security vulnerabilities in the provided ExpressJS router code. Only security concerns are listed, along with explanations and mitigation suggestions.

---

## 1. **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization**

### Issue

- The code directly uses inputs from `req.body` (e.g., `username`, `password`, `role`) and `req.params.id` in SQL statements without validation or sanitization.

### Risks

- **SQL Injection:** While parameterized queries are used (preventing basic injection), lack of validation may still result in unpredictable behaviorâ€”especially in user enumeration or DoS if bad data is inserted.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users can set their own roles when creating new users (see next issue).

### Mitigation

- Validate and sanitize all incoming data (e.g., using a library like `Joi`).
- Enforce type and format checks, especially on `username`, `password`, and `role`.
- Use strict schemas and reject requests with ill-formed data.

---

## 2. **Role Assignment on User Creation**

### Issue

- The API allows clients to specify the `role` field when creating a user:  
  ```js
  const { username, password, role = 'user' } = req.body;
  ```
- This could allow privilege escalation if not otherwise filtered.

### Risks

- **Privilege Escalation:** A user could create another user with the `admin` role (or any other privileged role) by supplying `{ "role": "admin" }`.

### Mitigation

- Never allow clients to specify roles directly unless additional checks are in place.
- Only allow admins to set roles, or always default new accounts to the least privileged role.
- Example fix:
    ```js
    const role = 'user'; // Don't use req.body.role
    ```

## 3. **Insufficient Authorization / Incorrect Middleware Usage**

### Issue

- Unclear if `authorizeAdmin` exists or works as intended on the GET `/users` route. 
- Other routes use `authorizeRole('admin')`, which is more appropriate, but if `authorizeAdmin` is misconfigured, exposure is possible.

### Risks

- **Unauthorized Access:** If the middleware protection is incomplete, attackers could list all users.

### Mitigation

- Confirm that all role-checking middleware is implemented securely.
- Standardize to a single, audited authorization function (e.g., always use `authorizeRole('admin')`).

---

## 4. **Exposed Internal Error Messages**

### Issue

- The code leaks internal error messages from the database to clients:
  ```js
  res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  ```

### Risks

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain insight into your database schema, errors, or stack traces.

### Mitigation

- Never expose raw internal errors to clients. Log details on the server, return generic messages to clients:
    ```js
    // Server log
    console.error(err)
    // Client
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    ```

---

## 5. **No Rate Limiting**

### Issue

- There is no rate limiting on any endpoints.

### Risks

- **Brute-force Attacks & Denial of Service:** Attackers can attempt to create, delete, or fetch data without restriction.

### Mitigation

- Implement rate limiting middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`).

---

## 6. **No CSRF Protection (if API is browser-accessible)**

### Issue

- No Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection evident in the code.

### Risks

- **CSRF Attack:** If authenticated sessions/cookies are used, attackers may exploit endpoints to create or delete users.

### Mitigation

- Use CSRF mitigation techniques if endpoints are accessible from browsers for session-authenticated users.

---

## 7. **No Password Policy Enforcement**

### Issue

- No password complexity, length, or reuse policy enforcement.

### Risks

- **Weak Credentials:** Users may create accounts with weak passwords, increasing risk of compromise.

### Mitigation

- Enforce password rules (min length, complexity).
- Use validation middleware or libraries.

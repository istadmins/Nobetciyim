# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided Express.js code for security vulnerabilities. The code exposes CRUD operations for a resource named `kredi_kurallari` using an SQLite database. Below are the identified security issues.

---

## 1. **Lack of Authentication and Authorization**

### Description
All routes (`GET /`, `POST /`, `PUT /`, `DELETE /:id`) lack any form of authentication (verifying the user's identity) and authorization (verifying the user's permission to perform an action). This means **anyone** with access to the API can read, add, update, or delete records.

### Impact
- Unauthorized users can access or modify sensitive data.
- Increased risk of data tampering or leaks.
- Potential for abuse by malicious actors.

### Recommendation
- Implement authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- Restrict access to endpoints based on user roles/permissions.

---

## 2. **SQL Injection Risks**

### Description
The code uses parameterized queries for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, mitigating SQL injection for those endpoints. However, there is a subtle risk in the following line:

```js
db.get('SELECT sabit_kural FROM kredi_kurallari WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id], ...)
```

While the query uses parameters, make sure `req.params.id` is validated, as some underlying libraries (less likely with SQLiteâ€™s `sqlite3` module) could behave unexpectedly if non-numeric values are passed.

### Impact
- If parameterization fails or underlying library is not secure, attackers could manipulate queries.
- Potential to bypass logic or alter data.

### Recommendation
- Always validate and sanitize input, e.g., ensure `id` is an integer before using.
- Continue using parameterized queries.

---

## 3. **No Input Validation**

### Description
No validation is performed on incoming request payloads. For example, in the `POST /` and `PUT /` routes, `req.body` values are used directly without checks.

### Impact
- Malformed or malicious data may be written to the database.
- Possible exploitation of backend or downstream services.
- Possible database errors leading to information disclosures.

### Recommendation
- Use a validation library (e.g., `Joi`, `express-validator`) to validate/sanitize all incoming data.
- Check types, formats, lengths, and allowed values.

---

## 4. **Error Message Exposure**

### Description
Error responses sometimes return `err.message` directly to clients, e.g.:

```js
return res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
```

### Impact
- Application internals or database structure may be leaked if exception messages are detailed.
- Useful information for attackers performing reconnaissance.

### Recommendation
- Do not return raw error messages to clients.
- Log errors on the server, but return only generic error messages to clients.

---

## 5. **Denial of Service (DoS) Through Resource Exhaustion**

### Description
The `GET /` endpoint returns all rows from `kredi_kurallari` with no pagination or query limits.

### Impact
- Large datasets may exhaust server resources or degrade performance.
- Attackers can intentionally trigger heavy-load queries as a DoS attack vector.

### Recommendation
- Implement pagination or result limiting on all endpoints returning lists.
- Rate-limit endpoints as appropriate.

---

## 6. **No CSRF Protection**

### Description
If this API is used in a browser context (e.g., with cookies/session auth), it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

### Impact
- Malicious web pages can perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.

### Recommendation
- If cookies/sessions are used, implement CSRF tokens or use double-submit cookies.

---

## 7. **HTTP Method Exposure**

### Description
All HTTP methods are exposed on the root or top-level routes. This increases the attack surface if not all methods are properly handled.

### Impact
- Attackers may probe for undocumented or weak endpoints.

### Recommendation
- Explicitly allow only necessary HTTP methods.
- Implement 405 Method Not Allowed responses for non-supported methods.

---

## 8. **Lack of Rate Limiting / Brute Force Protection**

### Description
There is no mechanism to limit the number of requests per user or IP.

### Impact
- APIs could be abused with automated attacks (e.g., brute forcing, spamming endpoints).

### Recommendation
- Use middleware like `express-rate-limit` to limit request rates.

# Recommendations

- **Implement strict authentication and authorization.**
- **Sanitize and validate all input data.**
- **Hide internal error messages.**
- **Add pagination to list endpoints.**
- **Apply security middlewares for rate limiting and CSRF protection (if applicable).**
- **Continuously monitor and update dependencies.**

**Note:** Secure coding practices are essential, especially for applications exposing CRUD operations on sensitive resources. Address the above vulnerabilities before deploying to production.
